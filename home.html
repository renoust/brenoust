     <i>"The world is one just so far as its parts
         hang together by any definite connexion. It is many just so far as any definite
         connexion fails to obtain. And finally it is growing more and more
         unified by those systems of connexion at least which human energy keeps
         framing as time goes on." </i> <br>

    <h2>Research Interests</h2>
    <p>
    Understanding the world in its complexity is a fascination which questions the place of human beings in the whole system. We do so by capturing the reminiscences of our interactions
    with the world and yet we merely grasp its comprehension. Often in our attempts to observe the world, we look at these precise interactions, at the level of which, networks appear
    to be an excellent means of study. We can visualize them, manipulate them, and analyse them. They are abstract structures and yet easy to visually interpret, almost as if they were
    tangible objects. Graph theory provides us strong means of analysis of networks, and their visualization challenges us in exploring them.<br/> I am fascinated by the explanatory power
    of such models, and my research aims at using the most adequate tools from theory to visualization to empower understanding of complex phenomena. I intend to confront my work with
    as many application domains possible, each enriching our research with a new set of questions and challenges pushing further our work.
